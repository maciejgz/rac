## ADR: What type of tests to use and what testing framework to use

### Context

We need to decide what type of tests to use and what testing framework to use. We need to consider the following
questions:
- what type of tests to write?
- what testing framework to use?
- Should we use Test Containers for integration tests? [Test Containers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)
- Should we test architecture using ArchUnit?
